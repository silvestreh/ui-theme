Atom UI theme with vibrancy support. Vibrancy it's kinda buggy and only available on macOS. You can use a background image to _imitate_ the effect on unsupported platforms (Windows and GNU/Linux).

Based on Simurai's starter template.

## Known issues üêû

I've only got one computer, a 2015 MacBook running macOS High Sierra `10.13.6`, and vibrancy it's buggy AF. It's not a theme issue, it's [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+vibrancy).
